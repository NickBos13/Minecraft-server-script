This is an easy to use script to make a minecraft server with the latest version of minecraft(Only for windows for now). You need to have java 21 installed(or the version that is required for the latest minecraft version).
The script has an built in updater that upgrades the minecraft version to the latest. Also an ramchanger to add more ram to your minecraft server. And ofcourse a start script to start the minecraft server. 
After you use the initial script for the first time, you don't need it anymore. You can update and start the server with the scripts mentioned previously. Which are located in the main "minecraft-server" folder.
!!Disclaimer: I am not an expert in making scripts so there is probably a better or more efficient way I could have made the script. All feedback is appriciated
